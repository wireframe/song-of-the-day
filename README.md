## Features

- **Random Selection**: Picks a random song from your Spotify library
- **History Tracking**: Avoids repeating recently played songs
- **Multiple Sources**: Pulls from both saved tracks and your playlists
- **Preview URLs**: Shows preview links when available
- **CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command line interface

## Authentication

On first run, you'll be prompted to authenticate with Spotify. The app will:
1. Open your browser to Spotify's authorization page
2. After you authorize, it will redirect to a local callback
3. Save your tokens for future use

Tokens are automatically refreshed when they expire.

## File Structure

- `index.js` - Main CLI application
- `spotify-auth.js` - Handles Spotify authentication
- `song-fetcher.js` - Fetches songs from Spotify API
- `song-selector.js` - Random selection with history tracking
- `.spotify-tokens.json` - Stored authentication tokens (created automatically)
- `.song-history.json` - Song selection history (created automatically)
